                    We’ll begin with a box, and the plural is boxes,<br>
                    But the plural of ox becomes oxen, not oxes. <br>
                    One fowl is a goose, but two are called geese, <br>
                    Yet the plural of moose should never be meese. <br>
                    You may find a lone mouse or a nest full of mice, <br>
                     Yet the plural of house is houses, not hice. <br>
                   </p></font>
                   <p><font size=2px>
                   <u>If</u>  the plural of man is always called men,<br>
                    Why shouldn’t the plural of pan be called pen? <br>
                   <u>If</u>  I speak of my foot and show you my feet, <br>
                    And I give you a boot, would a pair be called beet? <br>
                   <u>If</u>  one is a tooth and a whole set are teeth, <br>
                    Why shouldn’t the plural of booth be called beeth? <br>
                    </p></font>
                   <p><font size=1px> 
                    Then one may be that, and three would be those,<br>
                    Yet hat in the plural would never be hose,<br>
                    And the plural of cat is cats, not cose. <br>
                    We speak of a brother and also of brethren, <br>
                    But though we say mother, we never say methren. <br>
                    Then the masculine pronouns are he, his and him, <br>
                    <del><i>imagine the feminine: she, shis and shim!</i></del></p></font>
